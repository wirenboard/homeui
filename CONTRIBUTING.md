# Contributor Guidelines

We welcome external contributions, especially when it comes to fixing bugs, improving stability, or enhancing the documentation.

If you're planning to submit a **new feature**, please note:

> **You must discuss the idea on [our support forum](https://support.wirenboard.com/) before starting development.**

Some changes may not align with our product vision, so it's important to confirm relevance in advance.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a separate branch for your changes.
2. Make sure your code passes all lint checks.
3. Submit the pull request using the PR template.
4. If you're adding a feature, include a link to the forum discussion.
5. Wait for a maintainer to review your PR. We reserve the right to reject changes that do not align with the project vision.

Thank you for contributing!
